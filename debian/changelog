linux-6.1-rockchip (6.1~rc7+rockchip-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/patches: fix bug reporting 0% battery charge.
    The threshold for the "low battery" condition is set too low, causing
    issues where the battery driver reports 0% remaining charge while it's
    actually way higher. This in turn causes g-s-d to auto-shutdown the
    device even when active. Let's revert to the previous threshold value so
    we don't run into this problem.
